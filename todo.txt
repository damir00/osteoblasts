i want BOOM to follow that 3d effect at certain moments, when the player presses every 2nd button/click
and when he presses the START button at start screen
like the one when ship goes into collision with anything

then, i want these red lines to pulse, gain and lose saturation

and the letter "goes the asteroid" also to pulse a bit, some random letters to lose half or 30% of opacity
for a 0.3 or 0.5 seconds

can you pick other colors for the 3d? like traditional blue and red?

and as for the background, yes please make this black overlay more transparent and
beneath it the scrollable background from game but I think without the terrain

[20:03:06] Igor Grincu: I want the blinking to be immediate, very short delay
[20:03:17] Igor Grincu: and at max 3 letters at a time
[20:03:32] Igor Grincu: as for the frequency, not sure yet
